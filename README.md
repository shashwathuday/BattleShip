Here’s a README for your Battleship-style game code:

# Battleship Game

This is a simple text-based **Battleship game** implemented in Python. The player has 4 chances to guess the location of the hidden ship on a 5x5 grid.

## How the Game Works

- A 5x5 grid is created where each cell is represented by an "O".
- A hidden battleship is placed randomly on the grid.
- The player gets 4 turns to guess the location of the battleship by inputting row and column coordinates.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - If the guess is correct, the player wins.
  - If the guess is incorrect, the game continues and the guessed position is marked with an "X".
  - If the guess is out of bounds or a position has already been guessed, appropriate feedback is provided.
- After 4 incorrect guesses, the game ends with "Game Over".

## Code Overview

- **`board`**: A 5x5 grid initialized with "O" representing the ocean.
- **`random_row()` and `random_col()`**: Functions that generate random row and column coordinates for the battleship.
- **`print_board()`**: Function to print the current state of the board in a user-friendly format.
- **Game loop**: The player has 4 turns to guess the ship’s location. The game provides feedback based on the player's guesses.

## Example

```
Turn 1
Guess Row: 2
Guess Col: 3
You missed my battleship!
```

## How to Run

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed).
2. Run the script in the terminal or command prompt using:
   ```bash
   python battleship.py
   ```
3. Input your guesses when prompted.

## Future Enhancements

- Add multiple ships to increase difficulty.
- Implement a larger board with more turns.
- Allow diagonal movement for more complex strategies.
- Add a replay option at the end of the game.
